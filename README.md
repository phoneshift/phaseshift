![workflow](https://github.com/phoneshift/phaseshift/actions/workflows/test-multi-platform.yml/badge.svg)

The goal of phaseshift library is to provide basic construction blocks to build technologies about audio signal processing.
It will stay low-level (no compilation of plugins, graphical interface, etc. that's not the goal here).

For example:
* `audio_block/ol.h` provides a class to split an audio signal into frames.
* `audio_block/ola.h` provides a class to split an audio signal into frames and reconstruct a new one based on the processed frames.


## Properties
* No dynamic memory allocation
* No memory drift: Memory usage has to be constant, not linear to the length the audio signal.
* Constant latency, and known a priori.
* Neutral params -> Still perfect resynthesis
* No implicit conversions
* Language: C++17
* Multi-platform

These properties should be enforced by the API as much as possible. I.e. there should be no means to use the library that would not satisfy any of these properties.

`dev` namespace has exception to those properties.
Thus, any code used from the namespace `phaseshift::dev` is not meant for production.

## Compilation

If you're using conda, start with:

    $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig/

Then:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake .. -DPHASESHIFT_DEV_TESTS=ON -DPHASESHIFT_SUPPORT_SNDFILE=ON
    $ make
    $ ctest


## Builder usage

The construction of processing blocks follows a builder design pattern.
You first have to instanciate a builder for the audio block you want to create:

    phaseshift::ola_builder b;

Then, you set the parameters of `b` that will be constant over the full use of the audio processing block to come.

    b.set_timestep(sr*0.05);
    b.set_winlen(sr*0.020);

Then you build the audio processing block:

    phaseshift::ola p = b.build();

And finally you can use `p`:

    p.proc(input, &output);
    p.flush(&output);

In doing so, we ensure through the API, that it is not possible to change some parameters of `phaseshift::ola` that are supposed to stay constant through all the processing.
